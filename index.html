                <p>
                    Escape from everyday life and spend a few warm and relaxing days in with us. Enjoy the refreshing
                    mountain air. Discover
                    the village and the surrounding mountains on foot or with our bikes. Visit our spa or ski runs
                    during a winter visit, or
                    take a guided hike during the warmer months. We offer something for everyone!

                    mountains and valleys, we
                    have it all. You can hit the slopes and build a snowman in the winter, and you can head out for a
                    hike, picnics, and
                    swimming in the spring and summer. Escape the ordinary with us!
